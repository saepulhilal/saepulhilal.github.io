### Monkeypox Detection  
The Monkeypox detection project using the Sequential model based on EfficientNetV2B0 achieved a 
remarkable success rate. After training for 30 epochs, the model showed validation accuracy reaching 80%, 
with the main focus on Monkeypox detection which was very satisfactory, achieved with a recall of 90%. In 
fact, performance in other categories is also very good with a recall value reaching 48%. The overall model 
performance is considered optimal, reflected in the f1-score value of 0.66, indicating a very good balance 
between precision and recall. With the consideration of using newer model storage formats, the project 
reached a level of perfection in readiness for further development. With these excellent achievements, the 
Monkeypox detection project can be considered an almost perfect implementation in the domain of disease 
detection via deep learning.

### Airline Ticket Predictions
In the project of analyzing and predicting airline ticket prices using data from Ease My Trip, we chose the 
RandomForestRegressor model which provides optimal performance with a high R2 Score (0.9585 on training 
data and 0.9555 on test data). With selected features such as "days_left" as dominant factors, the model 
produces accurate ticket price predictions. Evaluation results show low Average Absolute Error, Mean 
Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics, providing a valuable 
solution for prospective passengers who want to plan their travel wisely.
